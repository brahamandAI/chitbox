# 🚀 MAIL SERVER SETUP - ACTION REQUIRED

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

1. **Array Error Fixed** ✓
   - Backend email queue now properly handles PostgreSQL arrays
   - No more "malformed array literal" errors

2. **Mail Server Setup Script Created** ✓
   - Automated installation of Postfix + OpenDKIM
   - DKIM key generation
   - Complete DNS record generation

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS (Run This Now!)

### Step 1: Run the Setup Script

```bash
cd /home/chitbox/htdocs/chitbox.co/chitbox
sudo ./setup-mail-server.sh
```

**This will:**
- Install Postfix (mail server)
- Install OpenDKIM (email authentication)
- Generate DKIM keys
- Configure everything automatically
- Show you DNS records to add

### Step 2: Add DNS Records

After running the script, it will show you DNS records. Add them in **Hostinger**:

1. **SPF Record** - Prevents email spoofing
2. **DKIM Record** - Email signature
3. **DMARC Record** - Email policy  
4. **MX Record** - Mail server address
5. **PTR Record** - Contact Hostinger support

### Step 3: Restart Backend

```bash
cd /home/chitbox/htdocs/chitbox.co/chitbox/backend
npm run dev
```

## 📋 DNS Records Location

After running the setup script:
- **Console output** - Shows all records
- **File** - `DNS_RECORDS.txt`

---

## ⚡ Quick Test

After setup, test email sending:

```bash
# Send test email
echo "Test from ChitBox" | mail -s "Test" your-email@gmail.com

# Check mail queue
sudo mailq

# View mail logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/mail.log
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

**Before Setup:**
- ❌ Emails fail with SMTP authentication errors
- ❌ External emails not delivered

**After Setup:**
- ✅ Emails sent through your own server
- ✅ DKIM signed (trusted by Gmail/Outlook)
- ✅ No external SMTP services needed
- ✅ High deliverability rate

---

## 📊 Benefits

1. **Full Control**: Your own mail server
2. **No Limits**: No daily sending limits
3. **Privacy**: Emails don't go through third parties
4. **Professional**: Emails from @chitbox.co
5. **Spam Prevention**: Proper authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)

---

## 🆘 If You See Errors

The script requires root access. If you see permission errors:

```bash
sudo chmod +x setup-mail-server.sh
sudo ./setup-mail-server.sh
```
